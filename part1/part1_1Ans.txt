1) How can we make the script globally reachable?

- Method1:
By moving the script file to the PATH in which all environment variables are searched for
This is done by writing in the terminal: echo ${PATH} or printenv PATH
then moving the script in the path that gets printed
for example: sudo mv userdef.sh /usr/bin/userdef

- Method2:
To add the directory of the script to the PATH in bashrc
This is done by: nano ~/.bashrc
Then if the script is located in "~/Linux_edges_training/Linux_Adminstration_Projects/part1/scripts"
In the last line: export PATH="$PATH:~/Linux_edges_training/Linux_Adminstration_Projects/part1/scripts"


2) How can we make this change to be permanent?

By adding the file path to the bashrc
This is done by: nano ~/.bashrc
Then if the script is located in "home/honda/Linux_Adminstration_Project/part1/scripts"
In the last line: export PATH="$PATH:home/honda/Linux_Adminstration_Project/part1/scripts"

3) To make the change happen now in this terminal?

We just run source ~/.bashrc
