# First we need to grant the user we created sudo access before switching users, this is done by:
sudo usermod -aG sudo mostafa

# Now we can switch to the newly created user by running:
su - mostafa

# Display all the files inside the extracted folder recursively and with long listing format
ls -lR /home/mostafa/project_dir

# Change to owner of this directory recursively to be the new user
sudo chown -R mostafa:mostafa /home/mostafa/project_dir
# You will be asked to write the password you entered while creating the user

# Again, display all the files inside the extracted folder recursively and with long listing format
ls -lR /home/mostafa/project_dir

# Search for the word “file” in the extracted directory recursively
grep -r "file" /home/mostafa/project_dir

# Remove all the files ending with “.c”
rm /home/mostafa/project_dir/*.c
